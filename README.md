# PDF to Excel using ABBYY

These Python files help with the task of converting a table from a PDF document to an Excel file, reducing the time spent on manual corrections.

### create_pdf_for_abbyy.py:
This file splits the large PDF into the specific pages needed, which can then be processed in ABBYY.

### correct_mistakes_functions.py: 
This file contains functions that correct the common mistakes Iâ€™ve identified after working with Excels converted by ABBYY. 
It's important to note that each PDF is different, and the errors vary in each Excel file generated by ABBYY. 
Therefore, we can add functions or make adjustments if we find that these are not enough.

### correct_mistakes.py:
This file contains the code to improve the Excel output from ABBYY, eliminating common and easily recognizable mistakes using the functions from the file mentioned above. 
It is still important to check the numbers manually or with other techniques, as there are always additional errors and some that are not recognizable because they are less frequent.
